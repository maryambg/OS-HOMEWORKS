Latex is a system for arranging letters, which is very suitable for producing scientific and mathematical writing with excellent compositions.

First we create the desired project, then we call all the packages that are used in the project using the \ documentclass command

Then we start writing using the subtext command. \ Begin {document}

Then we use the following commands to enter the title of the article and the names of the authors

\ title {TITLEOF PAPER}

\ {author {Name

Then enter the following command: / maketitle

To create a section, use the following command: \ section

To insert the shape in Latex program, we use the following command code:

\}} includegraphics [width]

This command specifies the title of the shape to be placed under it. \ Caption

To place the header in the text of the article, we also use the following command:

\ begin {tabular} {| c | c | c | c | c | c | |

This command indicates that there are vertical lines in the table and the text is in the center of each cell. | C | c | c | c | c | c |

This instructs them to be placed horizontally in the table of lines. \ hline

At the end, we complete the whole project using the following command

\ end {document}
